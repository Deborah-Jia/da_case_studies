Kezdi has streatmlined Stata code

TO DO:
Fig 4.1 , 4.2, 
the histograms looks different in Stata and also in R 
(the R and stata figures look more similar, the proof figure looks different)
(the R code wouldn't run on my machine, it complains about percent_format(accuracy = 1)
 but it produces the figures when I delete that part)
Fig 4.3
all three (Stata, R, proof) are different

Table 4.1
the sic code was 3-digit originally
now it's cut back to 2 digits in "$data_in\wms_da_textbook.dta"
this way it's impossible to fully reconstruct the broad industry classification
(electronics and other are off, the rest are fine)
