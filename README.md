# da_case_studies
Codes for case studies for the Bekes-Kezdi Data Analysis textbook

(c) Cambridge University Press, 2020

## Organization
1. Each case study has a separate folder.
2. Within case study folders, codes in different languages are simply stored together. 
3. Some intermediary files (csv, dta, rds) may be saved there, too. 
4. Currently output is not stored here 

## How to set up your project

Step 1: Create a new Rstudio project for the case studies (or make sure some other way that your working directory is the root folder of the case study repository)

Step 2: Create an .Renviron file in your project folder where you define the directory that contains the use case data (see .Renviron_sample)
